**Mid-way through the PlayStation 3's lifecycle, Sony embarked on improving the digital stores. I was involved in both formative and summative research projects to help Sony understand their web store customers and iron out usability issues with their console store prototype.**

## My role
Research planner and moderator.

## Our approach

* [Web store research – Diary study](#webstore)
* [Console store research – Depth interviews with prototype (~3 weeks)](#consolestore)

### <a name="webstore"></a>Web store research – Diary study
For their web store, Sony had a range of analytics data to understand users' behaviour but had a knowledge gap around *why* people behaved in this certain way. This was later followed up with a UI design project acted on the user insight that was gathered.

I designed a diary study and workbook for respondents to complete in their own time. At the time, game prices were higher and a game purchase was a highly considered decision. For this reason, I designed a study that encouraged participants to record all relevant activities including game research, demo downloading and canvassing the opinions of others through reviews or gaming communities, both real and virtual.

Here are some excerpts from the workbook:

I introduced some more focused activities to help record participants' thoughts on the PlayStation store and map the customer experience:

### <a name="consolestore"></a>Console store research – Depth interviews with prototype
For their console store, Sony came to us with a high fidelity prototype preloaded on a development console. Because we were already quite far through the design process, the objective of the research was to identify and prioritise quick wins before its launch. Unlike web and other software testing, there are far fewer conventions with console UI design. This made the analysis and recommendations more exciting for me and I was keen to avoid making recommendations that would dilute the design concept that Sony had created. Instead, I focused on allowing users to have more fun exploring the content (which tied into one of Sony's design principles - "Sometimes it's fun to throw away the map.") and making better use of accelerators such as using the controller's shoulder buttons to move more quickly through new content.

## Project challenges

### Internal changes meant that the web store research was never deployed
After designing the study, internal factors meant that the study was never released and effort was invested in other projects. If you are interested in how I translate diary studies into actionable insights, I also ran a large diary study over five countries for an online gaming provider. I would be happy to give more information about this project.

### Testing on a games console required a different environment to standard web or software lab research
To better simulate the actual context of console use, we transformed our research labs into a lounge with a sofa and an average sized television. It was important to recreate the posture of home use, positioning the user further away from the screen. Observations around the discoverability of onscreen items, for example, could have been biased if the user was sat too close or was in a less relaxed position.

### The console store prototype differed greatly from a standard PS3 console
Although it ran on PS3 hardware, the console store prototype behaved in a very different way. Because it was still in development, the output from the console was not the correct size for standard televisions. To display the prototype correctly and record the sessions, we had to conduct extensive pilot tests to ensure the sessions would run smoothly.
