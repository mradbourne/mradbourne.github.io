**In 2013, the merger between Lloyds Bank and TSB ended, giving TSB the opportunity to create a new and exciting brand geared towards "local banking for Britain". I was part of the TSB public site redesign team and led the design of the branch locator.**

In addition to many expected features of a bank branch locator, we were asked to:

- Embody TSB's tagline "Local banking for Britain."
- Demonstrate that TSB is "different from other banks."

Performance targets were left to one side and the goal of the project was to be the release of a web-based branch locator that addressed a list of user stories. We worked with TSB to create and prioritise these, which really helped the project run smoothly.

## My role
Lead interaction designer, managing a designer and a researcher.

## Our approach (~6 weeks)
1. [Competitor review](#competitorreview)
1. [Branch staff survey](#survey)
1. [UI concept sketching](#sketching)
1. [Clickable prototype creation](#prototype)
1. [Prototype testing with customers](#testing)
1. [Visual design](#visual)
1. [Build support](#build)

### <a name="competitorreview"></a>Competitor review
Having worked with the client to build a list of user stories, we began by looking at how other sites catered for each of these. Our Pinterest board filled up with a wide range of examples across web, tablet and phone app. We also started an inspiration wall in the office to flood the team with branch locator design patterns. This helped us have the discussion. Printouts were critiqued, scribbled on and, importantly, used to help the team align on the design vision for the project.

### <a name="survey"></a>Branch staff survey
The branch locator plays an important role in reducing calls to the branches about standard information. We looked to the TSB branch staff to provide us with the most common. This helped us prioritise the information that featured in the UI concepts that we would later create.

### <a name="sketching"></a>UI concept sketching
After the competitor review, we moved on to brainstorming concepts that addressed all of the user stories. I paired with the other designer and we challenged ourselves to spend no more than a few minutes on each concept. The concepts that we generated ranged from conventional and safe to daring and unfeasible so, after this initial design session, we evaluated the concepts to make sure they were a good fit for TSB's brand values (local banking for Britain, different from other banks) and the items in the user stories document.

### <a name="prototype"></a>Clickable prototype creation
After this, we transformed the concepts into two clickable Axure prototypes. The fidelity of these was kept low because feedback on visual style was less important at this time.

### <a name="testing"></a>Prototype testing with customers
We took the prototypes into user research sessions with 12 existing TSB customers. The sessions were mainly geared towards testing the usability of each prototype and, to a lesser extent, obtaining feedback on how well they embodied TSB's values.

### <a name="visual"></a>Visual design
Based on user feedback, the two prototypes were merged together based on the elements of each that were especially successful in the user research. The resulting concept was given a full visual design and adjusted as necessary.

### <a name="build"></a>Build support
The artwork files and an annotated prototype were delivered to the build agency. This was followed up with face-to-face and phone discussions in order to make sure that the necessary information was transferred to the build team in the most efficient way.

For complex behaviour, we supplied additional diagrams for the build team's reference. This diagram describes the behaviour of the autocomplete field when the user types a location into it:

## Project challenges

### The branch locator was to be launched before the rest of the site
We designed the branch locator to align with the new TSB public site design but, due to business deadlines, the branch locator needed to be launched before the rest of the site. We overcame this challenge by offering suggestions on integrating the new branch locator with the old site along with the potential impact of each option. We discussed the pros and cons of integrating the new tool inside the page with a different grid and stylesheet, launching the tool in a new window and delaying the launch of the branch locator so that it could be introduced with the rest of the new site.

### The style guide was not defined until late in the process
The rest of the public site was being designed in parallel with the branch locator. This meant that, up until the high-fidelity visual design started, the new TSB style guide was incomplete, missing elements such as the site grid and details of the colour scheme. This required close communication with visual design team to ensure that the branch locator wireframes worked well with the each iteration of the style guide.
