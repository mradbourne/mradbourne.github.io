**An international news corporation commissioned me to understand how to improve the multi-channel newspaper publishing workflow. The organisation was moving from a print-first workflow to a platform-agnostic one and this involved a change to the content authoring system as well as internal processes.**

The new system had been rolled out in advance of the new workflow so I spent time with stakeholders and the editorial team to understand how this software accommodated the current tablet workflow.

I focussed on investigating the usability, efficiency and communication between users and departments and the end goal of the project was to help my primary client communicate findings and recommendations around this to the wider organisation.

My performance on this initial project for the client won us a much bigger programme of work with them.

## My role
User experience consultant on-site at the newspaper's offices, working closely with their Head of Digital.

## Our approach (~1 month)
1. [Depth interviews with the editorial teams and heads of department](#depths)
1. [Contextual enquiry with the editorial teams during their shift](#contextualenquiry)

### <a name="depths"></a>Depth interviews with the editorial teams and heads of department
I arranged interviews with heads of department. I then spoke to members of the editorial team to probe around the areas raised by the heads of department and also capture new issues and feedback.

As issues arose, I began to add them an 'issues wall' that I maintained throughout the project.

### <a name="contextualenquiry"></a>Contextual enquiry with the editorial teams during their shift
I was able to spend an entire shift with several members of the editorial team. During the quieter periods, I asked them a series of prepared questions to uncover their views and probed around their responses. During busier periods of time, I sat back and recorded their activities so that I could follow these up with further discussion at a later time. I observed how the communication within the team changed during busier periods and how their systems accommodated the workflow.

Exploring the workplace environment helped me understand how the system was used in context. This uncovered findings around how their dual-screen configurations were utilised and what kind of shortcuts were used by more experienced staff used to help them accelerate their work.

As findings arose from the contextual enquiry, I added them to the issues wall that I started during the depth interviews. I colour-coded the issues to aid analysis:

* Yellow post-its represented issues identified in the depth interviews
* Green post-its represented issues identified from the contextual enquiry
* Pink post-its represented suggested features and solutions from participants as well as ideas from myself that address their needs and pain points

I organised each issue and solution into its appropriate place in the editorial journey so, when I reported these back to the client, I was able to clearly talk them through the journey from start to finish.

Where appropriate, recommendations included estimated time-savings to help the client prioritise these issues with the development team.

## Project challenges

### Publishing is historically a print-first process
Much of the newspaper's heritage is related to the design of the print edition so many of my observations were related to tasks that sub-editors undertook to adjust the presentation of the tablet edition. My report communicated that inefficiencies in the tablet workflow were not completely due to the UI, but due to the fact that the presentational adjustments were not appropriate for the varied tablet ecosystem. I was keen to communicate issues that were wider than the UI and careful to deliver this argument in a constructive way to an audience who did not have the authority to make such a significant business decision.
