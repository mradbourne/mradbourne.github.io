**Aviva had the vision of creating a consolidated control panel for customer to manage all of their policies from their mobile phone. I worked on-site with the team at Aviva for three weeks in order to help them deliver a cross-platform UI solution for the MyAviva app ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id852352703) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.uk.aviva.myavivaapp)).**

We had the opportunity to more than just bring the web experience over into to an app. The client was keen to explore designs that made innovative use of mobile device hardware, be this touchscreen interactions or other device hardware that only an app can access.

## My role
Lead interaction designer and UX consultant for the Agile team. Quality checkpoint for design work.

## Our approach (~1 month)
I worked across three parallel workstreams:

* [Agile sprints for release 1 of the apps](#agile)
* [Interaction design of the car insurance claims feature (planned for release 2)](#carclaims)
* [Design and build of the app's public site](#publicsite)

### <a name="agile"></a>Agile sprints
As UX support, I attended all standups and integrated with the JIRA workflow, which allowed me to be on standby to help tackle any blockers related to UI.

I had to lead delicate discussions about user story prioritisation with senior stakeholders. I used whiteboard sketching and rapid prototyping to help communicate UI quick-wins for build work that was already estimated and assigned to sprints. Encouragingly, the team at Aviva were very happy to work closely with me to review and prioritise, achieving better outcomes for the user without putting unfair demand on the build team.

### <a name="carclaims"></a>Interaction design for car insurance claims feature
As lead interaction designer for car insurance claims, I focussed on making the best use of modern technology to help give the car insurance team as much information as possible to process. We all know that typing a lot of text on small devices is quite painful, so I used as many modern techniques as I could to reduce the amount of user work involved in capturing data.

Before putting pen to paper, I met with the car insurance team at Aviva to understand their priorities and pain points. The two main problems that the design had to overcome were:
* The amount of information provided did often not give Aviva a complete picture of the incident
* The clarity or accuracy of the data meant that it was often not reliable

To address these problems, I designed a feature that was split into two parts: The first was a "quick capture" part that helped the claimant capture information at the scene of an accident (where relevant) to ensure that it was clear and accurate. This included photographs of damage, witness statements and other environmental information. This kind of evidence is captured in-situ to improve its accuracy.

The second part was a "post-incident writeup" part that allowed the user to input additional information to better explain the case to Aviva. Both parts were combined in a checklist format to help the claimant record a comprehensive account of the accident before submitting to Aviva.

The overall process was represented as a checklist that could be populated with details before submitting the claim to Aviva:

The damage recording feature made use of maps and diagrams to quickly capture information on a touchscreen interface:

The Axure claim prototype simulated the behaviour of dynamic widgets to help explain the IA to stakeholders at Aviva:

### <a name="publicsite"></a>Public site
Unlike the other two workstreams, the public site design stream saw me critiquing another designers work, ensuring adherence to Aviva's requirements, their brand and usability heuristics. In these sessions, I critiqued the work and explored it with the designer, rather than giving my opinion on the "correct" solution. I wanted the designer to feel like he owned the work whilst making sure that we had been rigorous in our approach.

## Project challenges

### I was a late arrival to the team
I was brought in to help on the Agile sprints later than the build team. This meant that achieving integration with the team was challenging. I had to quickly learn about the internal team setup and ensure that I had consulted all of the necessary stakeholders when making decisions about sprint prioritisation.

### There was no agreed way of communicating my designs
Being the lead UX designer, there was no precedence set for how I integrated with the team at Aviva. I set regular checkpoints with a range of stakeholders and, at certain points in the project, I asked to sit in different parts of the office to work closely with others. This meant that I was seen as an active and reliable member of the overall team.
