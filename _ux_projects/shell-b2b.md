**I have conducted extensive work for Royal Dutch Shell over the past 3 years. Working closely with large development teams at CGI and Wipro, I have helped Shell design and build large-scale business-to-business software. This software provides businesses worldwide to learn about, buy and track orders of fuels and lubricants.**

I'd like to tell you about my work for Shell's fuel card system 'Shell Card Online' (SCOL) although please feel free to get in touch for more information on other projects. This system allows Shell customers to order new fuel cards and track and manage their existing ones.

Through the redesign of SCOL, we achieved:

* A 15% increase in the number of fuel cards ordered via SCOL.
* An 18% reduction in calls to Shell's customer service centre for certain segments.
* A positive improvement to Shellâ€™s Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) and NPS scores.

## My role
Lead designer, co-ordinating a team of 2 researchers and 2 interaction designers. As lead designer, I also led the scoping of the project, which was completed on time and budget.

## Our approach (~3 months)

* [Exploratory research](#explore)
* [Concept generation](#concepts)
* [Concept validation research](#conceptvalidation)
* [Prioritisation workshop](#workshop)
* [Medium-fidelity prototype creation](#prototype)
* [Prototype validation research](#prototypevalidation)
* [Design documentation](#documentation)

### <a name="explore"></a>Exploratory research
After familiarising ourselves with SCOL and all of the associated services, we arranged a set of telephone interviews with SCOL customers to better understand their priorities and pain points. Whilst collecting requirements and user insight, we began to sketch rough ideas for solutions to these.

### <a name="concepts"></a>Concept generation
After completing the customer interviews, we generated a set of around 30 one-page feature concepts (example shown below) to address customers' needs and pain points. We made sure to return to our interview notes before compiling our final list of concepts to ensure that we hadn't become biased towards certain ideas that we had already sketched.

Each concept included:

* A title
* An illustration
* A description
* Evidence from the customer research that prompted the generation of the concept
* A reference to Shell's pre-existing change requests where their purpose aligned with our concepts

### <a name="conceptvalidation"></a>Concept validation research
We took each of these concepts into further customer research in order to measure their effectiveness for customers and see if we had correctly understood the original needs and pain points.

After the research, certain concepts were removed from the set because they were not particularly well received. These were put into the feature backlog, pending further research.

We updated the more successful concepts to include further evidence from this round of research. We also assigned a predicted value for the user, which could have been:

* Essential for all
* Very useful for all
* Very useful for some
* Quite useful for all
* Quite useful for some

This rating was based on our opinions because we represented the "voice of the user" in the design process but the customer feedback played a crucial role in informing this decision.

### <a name="workshop"></a>Prioritisation workshop
We conducted a workshop with senior stakeholders at Shell and the build partner, CGI. We walked through each of the concepts to explain their purpose and give context. CGI provided estimates for build effort and Shell provided their view on business priority.

To help teams such as the Shell marketing team, we presented the concepts in the form of user journeys to help us understand how concepts would help the user across all of their tasks in SCOL and how this could be promoted for the next release of SCOL.

To make this activity easy to track, we created a large matrix on the wall with 'user value' and 'build effort' as the axes. We marked items that were of higher priority to the business with a star sticky note. After the workshop, the output was converted to a slide that could be shared with other stakeholders.

### <a name="prototype"></a>Medium-fidelity prototype creation
Having defined the scope for the release, we sketched UI ideas that fulfilled each concept. After internal reviews, we locked down the designs and converted them into a medium fidelity interactive prototype to test with customers around the world.

### <a name="prototypevalidation"></a>Prototype validation research
The third and final engagement with customers was a set of task-based prototype tests conducted remotely. Customers from all around Europe were involved and these sessions were conducted in each participant's native language and later translated by organising a session with the foreign-language moderator and the rest of the project team.

### <a name="documentation"></a>Design documentation
After conducting this research, we iterated the prototype to address issues uncovered in testing and provided the designs to CGI in the form of annotated wireframes.

## Project challenges

### Prototype language barrier
We conducted the prototype testing sessions in foreign languages using an English language prototype. Because of this, we had to be careful so as not to alarm participants that were using a prototype in a non-native language. The session structure, participant recruitment and research analysis were all adjusted to accommodate this.
