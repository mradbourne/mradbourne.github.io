$ hello_world

Iâ€™m a web developer based in London.

I work in human-centred design teams that involve real users throughout the design process to create great digital products.

Some things you may not know about me:

* I help teach at [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/instructors/matt-radbourne/4393).
* I also make [movies](https://vimeo.com/72029612) and [music](https://soundcloud.com/mradbourne/sets/swandive-ep).
* I have worked with [children](/projects/affect-ed/), but not animals.
