Back in 2012, I took part in a hack called [Near Field Norwich](http://hotsourcenorwich.co.uk/2012/02/near-field-norwich-registration-is-open/), which was based around using Near Field Communications (NFC) technology similar to London's Oyster card system to make the world a slightly better place.

Several teams entered and presented their mobile-tapping ideas to a panel of judges, featuring the MD of leading NFC company, [Proxama](http://www.proxama.com/).

I produced interactive HTML prototypes for two concepts:

* Tap-to-Wifi
* Tap-to-bet

Because we were using [Proxama's](http://www.proxama.com/) Touchpoint platform to support the NFC functionality, I was able to build prototypes that actually worked when you tap your phone on real-world objects. The key to the magic was the bundle of programmable stickers that Proxama donated - These stickers send a URL to a mobile device when they come into contact with it.

My company Foolproof made some concept videos using my prototypes. See how we got on:

Let me explain the two concepts...



## 1. Tap-to-WiFi
Picture the scene: You arrive at your local coffee shop. The barista takes your order and writes your name (misspelt) on a paper cup. By the counter, you spot a sign that says "tap here for free WiFi". Intrigued, you take your phone out and tap the sign. Before you've even received your flat white, you're connected to the caf√©'s high-speed internet, ready to go.

Connecting to the WiFi could be as quick as Apple-paying for your coffee and would prevent people hunting high and low for the password. The original concept was devised by Norwich-based Andy King and Matthew Bolton and has received [a lot of press coverage](https://www.facebook.com/VirginMoneyUK/posts/255284824578362) recently... and deservedly so!

## 2. Tap-to-bet
With the 'tap-to-bet' concept, we aimed to shorten the gap between a prospective better's intention to bet, and actually going through with it.

Betting could be so easy and quick that it could be done by tapping on a horse's name on a betting shop window whilst walking past. It could be done by tapping on a football team's name on a bus stop poster. In future we might see this kind of betting done by people that wouldn't normally associate themselves with betting shops. The concept has potiential to build a new audience for itself.

## Too many exciting ideas to mention here
The Eastern Daily Press has helpfully listed [all of the cool ideas](http://www.edp24.co.uk/business/world_class_ideas_in_norwich_for_new_technology_1_1335029) put forward by the teams. It's a shame that I was only able to prototype two of the ideas, but I had great fun doing it, which you might be able to tell from these videos that we put together:
