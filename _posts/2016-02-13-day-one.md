I've launched my new website! At the time of writing, the whole thing is looking a bit sparse but you'll be seeing a variety of changes on the site in the near future.

I've put this minimum viable portfolio (MVP) online as it's the best way to showcase my development work to date. Up until now, a lot of my dev projects and general code tinkering have been on my hard drive gathering dust and I figure it's time to start sharing them with the world.

Welcome to the site. Make yourself at home.
